# Bryan's Portfolio

Welcome to my personal developer portfolio where I try to showcase my coding skills, and some of the projects I've worked on. This site serves as a presentation of myself as a programmer to anyone who could potentially work with me or hire me to do some work.

## Thought Process Behind the Design

I didnâ€™t want to go for some generic, boring, overly corporate portfolio. My goal was to make something that still looks premium, but also has personality. I also wanted to make the website more user-friendly with a few smooth animations and a burger navbar for mobile.

All my files are organized with scalability in mind. I made it so that more projects can easily be added to the project, more routes can easily be added to my router and more software can easily be added to my tech list.

## Implementation

The portfolio was built with:

- **React** for all the component structure
- **React Router** for navigation between pages
- **Styled-Components** for styling everything with scoped CSS
- **React Icons** for nav links and mobile menu
- **React Hooks** for responsivess

I did not end up using a CSS library for this project. Most of the CSS was built with the help of ChatGPT 4o. I would describe exactly what I needed an element to do with respect to its parent and/or child elements and it would give me some CSS properties that would fit the job. I would then simply tweak the properties to match what I needed. The chatbot along with chrome devtools were powerful tools that helped with bugs related to CSS, which were common when trying to optimize responsiveness between mobile and desktop.
